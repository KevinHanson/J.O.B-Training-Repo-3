# J.O.B-Training-Repo-3

This repository will be used to test your use of the Gitflow hotfix workflow. In this repository you will find a pay-calculator.py file that computes pay or overtime pay. The file has an error and will not execute properly. Please find the error in the Python code, correct it, close the hotfix and create a pull request. Afterwhich, please find the instructor for a code review. 

Please confirm that the program is working by using 41 hours as input, 12 dollars as rate of pay which should return $498 as the computed pay with 1 hour of overtime.
